# LEACH

LEACH is a Python code project that implements the LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol for wireless sensor networks. It provides a simulation of the LEACH protocol and includes a graphical interface to visualize the network nodes and their energy levels.

## LEACH Protocol Overview

The LEACH protocol is a widely used clustering algorithm in wireless sensor networks. It aims to reduce energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime by organizing sensor nodes into clusters and selecting cluster heads dynamically. The cluster heads perform data aggregation and transmit the aggregated data to the base station.

## Features

- Network Simulation: LEACH simulates the behavior of sensor nodes and their communication within the network.
- Cluster Formation: The protocol dynamically forms clusters with cluster heads selected for each round.
- Energy Monitoring: The app tracks and displays the energy levels of individual sensor nodes.
- Graphical Interface: The graphical interface visualizes the network nodes and their energy levels in real-time.
- Performance Metrics: LEACH calculates and provides performance metrics such as network lifetime, energy efficiency, and data transmission rate.

## Prerequisites

Before running the LEACH code, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x: [Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Matplotlib library: Install using `pip install matplotlib`
